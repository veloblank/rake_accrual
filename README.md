# Calculate accrued rake

This AutoHotKey application calculates the accrued rake over a poker session on PokerStars.

The script needs to be run as ".exe" due to PS TOS against AHK. This application is not against TOS, but is
built using AHK which could be used to script many "botting" programs.

The application detects tournament windows by their buyin and adds the appropriate accrued rake. On "submit", the
rake amount and the current date are added to an Excel ".csv" file, where it can be graphed and studied.

This application was made to assist me with motivation to play large amounts of tournaments each day, and helped to
break up the monotony of play on some days.

This is an ongoing WIP.
